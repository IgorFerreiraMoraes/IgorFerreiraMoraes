    <h1>Veganism, a Lifestyle</h1>
    <p>
        Veganism is a lifestyle that goes beyond a concern directed only at health and way of eating, affecting different areas of the daily lives of its supporters, however, along with this aspect, adversities appear, which can generate demotivation for people willing to start being vegan.

        Not eating meat or products from animal origin, not going to places that use animals in a bad way, not consuming products that are tested or derived from animals, are a small part of this activist movement, which fights the way animals are treated in parts of the industry, ceasing to be part of the monetary support of companies. For example a dairy industry, you need to be constantly producing milk, but cows are not always ready to give that milk, so methods are used to stimulate hormones produced during pregnancy that lead to the development of milk, these methods can be invasive, reaching a negative effect on animals, physically and psychologically, the same for other types of companies.

        In Brazil, the country with the largest herd of cattle, about 14% of the population (28 million inhabitants) declare themselves vegetarian and the majority would consume more vegan products if they were better indicated on the packaging and/or if they had the same price of products that are most commonly consumed, even some products not using animal sources, such as some bread that do not have eggs or milk in their composition, do not make this characteristic clear to the buyer, while in relation to prices, production may be delayed due to the use of pesticides and planting that is not harmful to the soil, not causing mass production, and with fewer products available, the higher the price, in addition to being aimed at a specific niche of the population and not for everyone.

        Common sense, derived from customs and united to lack of information and preconceptions, leads to judgment and aversion for followers of veganism, eating meat is a major characteristic in society and sometimes it is a cultural landmark, not eating meat is the defense of a cause, not just a culinary taste or trend. The lack of understanding of veganism provides jokes, as putting meat in a vegan's food to fool them, and exclusion, with comments about restaurants and social gatherings that vegans are not going to be called to for not eating meat.
    </p>
    <p>
        Raising awareness and the increasing of the number of vegans could solve a large part of the difficulties encountered by vegans, since, with a greater number of consumers, more products would be produced on a larger scale, lowering the price and making this lifestyle accessible, and awareness would come from understanding the ways animals are treated and reducing prejudice.
