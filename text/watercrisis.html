    <h1>Crisis in Water Resources</h1>
    <p>
        May it be due to drought or lack of access, more than a billion people around the world do not have the necessary clean water to live and we should be worried. According to the World Resources Institute, it is the reality of lots of humans.
    </p>
    <p>
        First of all, what is Water Resource? Water resources are unique, renewable resources, the waters with potential use to particular activities such as industrial, agricultural, environmental, re-creative, and others, which are crucial to life. In fact, even though they are essential and renewable, something that would appear that water is infinite, the freshwater reserves are being harassed, lowering, being able to take us to a scarcity, meaning we should protect it.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the way, not only the water is decreasing, but also the world is undergoing a population increase, around fifty years ago, the global population was less than half of the current number, it increased sharply, and the United Nations esteem that, judging by statistics, in twenty fifty we will have another population outburst and it is to reach 9.6 Billion. Given that, it leads to the increasing demand for water resources to direct consume or to food production.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the population, there are other reasons for the reduction of resources as inefficient practices and bad water management, especially in agribusiness and industry. Agribusiness uses seventy percent of the accessible freshwater, showed by The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, and a big part is wasted or polluted by pesticides and fertilizers. The reason why pollution of Water occurs is that plenty factors and makes the resources useless by the lack of treatment or even the natural cycle denial.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the worst things is that the reduction of available water would affect negatively the production of food and other products that depends on intensive water usage, a production that would need to keep up with the increasing demand and maybe wouldn’t stand a chance; even the workers would be affected, their productiveness would decrease since the needing to deal with diseases and the higher water cost. Assuming that, vulnerable populations would suffer more with diseases caused by lack of water or non-treated water and would need to be displaced.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, the climate is being changed, global warming impacts water resources because of the strict connections between weather and the hydric cycle, and, what is more terrifying, when water becomes meager, landscapes are changed, damaged or lost, zones with high humidity, dependents of water, are home to various ecosystems and concentrations of fauna and flora.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, to sum up, I couldn’t agree more that this is a serious problem, that shouldn’t just be glanced at or skimped on the solution but must be stared and something to bear in mind, with lots of consequences and that is presupposed to increase if the world continues the same, unless we fix it before regretting, the solutions go from the change in people's everyday life and don’t put up with this reality to bigger schemes, as improving the way animal and vegetable extraction and the industry use the water, focusing more in the recycle of residual water or addressing the importance of this situation that must not be underestimated
