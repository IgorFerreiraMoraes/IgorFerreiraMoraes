    <h1>Problems with Housework</h1>
    <p>
        More than 6 million domestic workers across Brazil provide these essential services, however, domestic work tends to demand a lot and is often undervalued. For a long time, most of the domestic work was informal, carried out outside labor regulations and social protections, making it necessary to create laws to guarantee basic rights, as a limit on the weekly working day, however, these people are still passive to face violence, abuse or discrimination.

        One of these implications is due to the stigma of what areas are considered female work and the traditional division of labor based on gender, for example, cleaning and caring actions are attributed to women, so men are few in this job market, and those who are in, tend to have jobs as a gardener or private driver. Many factors lead women to enter domestic work, people coming from poor families or disadvantaged communities and who may suffer prejudice based on gender, caste or class, race or ethnicity, generally have few job opportunities and end up being forced to submit themselves to those precarious working conditions. In addition to submission for wage dependence, a hierarchy emerges, in which domestic workers work or serve those who hire them.

        Bosses take advantage of some flaws in the legislation and a sense of superiority to circumvent the proposed rights, demanding extended working hours, giving an excessive amount of chores, firing without paying the money, or even continuing to use the services without delivering wages. Even with laws made so that does not happen, this type of treatment exists, since it is not easy to guarantee that it will be followed, as the work environment is the employers' own residence.

        It is important to increase the inspection and protection of domestic workers, mainly to ensure that their benefits and labor rights are not being inflicted. Another way to help would be to raise awareness about consideration and respect for others, which would change the situation, even if it is a smaller scheme. The way that people behave towards others, stoppin to treat them in a discriminatory way.
